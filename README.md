## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

- I've become more familiar with the properties for css grid.
- Responsive designing using Tailwind and experiencing how easy it is to use especially when working mobile first.
- Using the built-in NextJS components.

### Continued development

- NextJS is nice to use but I still need to use it more often to feel comfortable and speed up the workflow.
- Responsiveness can still be improved to fluidly fit to any screensize
- Custom type definitions in NextJS are still a bit unclear. For example extending `NextComponentType` with a classname prop.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind cheatsheet](https://umeshmk.github.io/Tailwindcss-cheatsheet/) - Nice overview of all the tailwind classes you can use with additional visuals.
- [Tailwind ring width](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/ring-width) - This was pretty cool to use. It made it a breeze to recreate the call to action with this classname.
- [Tailwind JIT](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) - The JIT compiler is great in multiple ways. First off because it only compiles the used classes and it gives the ability to make custom classes.
